Broadcasting
Broadcasting is a one-to-all type of communication, i.e. the intention is to send the datagram to all the nodes in the network. Unlike in the case of point-to-point communication, we don’t have to know the target host’s IP Address. Instead, a broadcast address is used.

By definition, routers connecting a local network to other networks don’t forward packets sent to this default broadcast address.
