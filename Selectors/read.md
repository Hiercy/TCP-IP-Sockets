A Selector is a Java NIO component which can examine one or more NIO Channel's, and determine which channels are ready for e.g. reading or writing. This way a single thread can manage multiple channels, and thus multiple network connections.

Why Use a Selector?
The advantage of using just a single thread to handle multiple channels is that you need less threads to handle the channels. Actually, you can use just one thread to handle all of your channels. Switching between threads is expensive for an operating system, and each thread takes up some resources (memory) in the operating system too. Therefore, the less threads you use, the better.
