Multicasting
Broadcasting is inefficient as packets are sent to all nodes in the network, irrespective of whether they are interested in receiving the communication or not. This may be a waste of resources.

Multicasting solves this problem and sends packets to only those consumers who are interested. Multicasting is based on a group membership concept, where a multicast address represents each group.
